      <h3>Hick’s Law</h3>
      <p>IKEA</p>

      <p>
        Ikea's website shows an example of the concept proposed in Hick’s Law.
        Hick’s Law mentions the idea that when we have more choices to select,
        the more time we take to make a decision. This concept applies to
        websites, and because of that, to develop a better website it's
        necessary to create a way to decrease the possible options to select.
        By doing that, it will be easier for individuals to make a decision
        and remain using the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the website, it can be seen how in its design process it developed
        a way to discard options that could be distracting. They did that by
        applying filters for their different products. At the same time, they
        made those filters more specific by allowing the user to sort them by
        different categories, and filter them based on specific
        characteristics such as color and price. Those filters help to
        accelerate and facilitate the decision-making process and make the
        website easier to use.

      <h3>Alignment</h3>
      <p>Codecademy</p>
      <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-hello-world/cheatsheet">codecademy.com</a>
      <img src="images/codecademy_picture.jpg" alt="Picture from the Codecademy website, displaying aligned content.">
      <p>
        Alignment is an important element to apply to a website. Applying it
        implies that the elements on the website should be aligned with one
        another. Thus, its elements have a sense of structure that helps
        improve the appearance of the website. Those characteristics and more
        can be seen in the example from Codecademy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The picture below shows how all its elements are well aligned
        horizontally. It also shows that while developing the page, its
        designers took into account the fact that in English-speaking
        countries people read from left to right, by applying left alignment.
        By applying those elements a sense of unity and connection between the
        image elements can be perceived. Due to that, the page looks better
        organized, and it's easier to contemplate.

      <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
      <p>UX Engineer</p>
      <a href="https://uxengineer.com/">uxengineer.com</a>
      <img class="image3" src="images/uxengineer_picture.jpg"
        alt="A picture from the UX Engineer website, that shows an example of a good visual hierarchy.">
      <p>
        Visual hierarchy is a critical element to consider while creating a
        webpage. An important aspect to have in mind while describing this
        concept is the order in which humans see things. Our eyes catch
        certain things first then others in dependence on different variables.
        That's relevant because based on that, and the importance one wants to
        give to each element of a website, different design principles are
        applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        UX Engineer provides a great example of how visual hierarchy is
        applied. In the image, it can be seen how the "email" and "subscribe"
        buttons stand out, especially the second one that it's more
        distinguishable due to the color choice that was applied to it. It's
        noticeable how the title it's the next thing that catches the eye due
        to its size. After that, the next thing to see in order of importance
        is the text below the title which is smaller in comparison. The less
        important things such as the message below the subscribe button are
        smaller and less eye-catching.
